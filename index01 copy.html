    <h2>General Perception</h2>
  <p>Wolves have been seen differently throughout history depending on the type of civilizations around them. Hunting civilizations revered them because of their hunting prowess and ability to work together to take down prey many times larger than themselves. Herding civilizations on the other had were not as fond of wolves that would poach their herds with little that they could do about it.  As civilizations grew they made contact with wolves more likely causing problems along the way. Still to this day, many people have love and respect for wolves.</p>

  <h3>Pack Dynamics</h3>
  <p>In recent times wolves have sometimes been seen as solitary creatures that roam the forests by themselves looking for prey but this is not there natural state. Wolves are actually incredibly social animals and if by chance they are out alone, it is because they are looking for a new pack to join.  These packs themselves are not as large as you might think either. They are more akin to a small family with a fairly rigid family hierarchy.</p>
